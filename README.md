✅ Why this looks attractive:

1. Large images (500px width) with shadows and rounded corners → professional look.


2. Images are stacked one under the other with clear titles.


3. Features section is clear and readable → good for GitHub or companies.


4. Simple yet visually appealing layout.

I can also make a full HTML version with colors, backgrounds, and hover effects to make it look like a real music app interface.

Do you want me to do that?
